# bsky-handles

a discord bot to register bluesky handles for a domain

## Dependencies
- a porkbun domain with api management enabled
  - if you need another dns provider, ripping out the porkbun code and replacing with your dns provider of choice should be trivial
- see package.json for the rest

## Setup

just make sure you have all the env vars set when you run it. using pm2 works really nicely for this

## Support
